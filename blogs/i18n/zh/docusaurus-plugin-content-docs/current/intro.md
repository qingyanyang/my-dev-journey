# Intro

This section records what I learn as a developer.

It is not a tutorial series and not a complete handbook.  
Instead, it is a **structured knowledge base** built from my real learning and work experience.

I focus on understanding:

- how things work
- why certain decisions are made
- where common mistakes happen

---

## What you’ll find here

### Frontend

Notes and explanations about:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React and modern frontend patterns
- UI, state management, and performance

I write these to clarify concepts for myself, not to copy documentation.

---

### Backend

What I learn about:

- APIs and server-side logic
- Data handling and validation
- .NET / Node concepts when they connect to frontend work

This part helps me understand the **full picture**, not just the UI.

---

### Cloud & Tools

Practical knowledge about:

- Deployment (Vercel, cloud platforms)
- Git and version control
- Build tools and configuration
- Things that often break in real projects

These are usually learned while solving real problems.

---

## How to use this section

- Each page is **independent**
- You don’t need to read in order
- Some content may be incomplete or updated later

This section grows as I grow.

## Why I write this

Writing helps me:

- slow down and think clearly
- turn confusion into understanding
- remember what I’ve learned

If it also helps someone else, that’s a bonus.
