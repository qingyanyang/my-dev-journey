## Picking Up LeetCode Again

It’s nice to see that I’ve picked up LeetCode again.

> Only people who have practiced it truly know how heavy it is.  
> For those who want to keep working in this field, you can’t really skip it — unless you don’t aim for big tech.

I’ve been back in China for about two weeks, and I’ve practiced LeetCode for around one week.  
I hadn’t touched it for almost three years, and honestly, it’s quite hard to pick it up again at the beginning.

A lot of people give up when they realize how easy it is to forget things.  
You have to do this work **again and again**, and at the same time, it often feels **not very useful in real work**.

I don’t want to be one of those people.

I truly believe that **hard work beats talent**, and I do have practical experience — but yeah, it’s easy to say.  
When it comes to reality, moving forward feels **awful and exhausting**.

## My Goal

My short-term goal is clear and realistic:

- Pass a **basic OA**:
  - **2 Easy + 1 Medium**
  - **120 minutes**
- Be able to do **live coding**:
  - Easy → Medium
  - In a real-time interview setting

I only have **3.5 weeks**.

That means I need to become familiar with **all types of problems** — not just for this interview, but also so that I can **reuse this preparation in the future**.

Next time, I don’t want to repeat this whole process from scratch.  
I want it to be **more efficient**, and hopefully, less painful.

## My Plan

The schedule is **very tight**, but this is the plan:

### 🟡 Phase 1: Warm-up (1.5 weeks)

- Refresh all major categories
- Spin up core problem patterns
- Focus on fundamentals and recognition

### 🔵 Phase 2: LeetCode 100 (1 week)

- Go through the most common problems
- Build pattern familiarity
- Improve speed and confidence

### 🟢 Phase 3: Historical Questions (1 week)

- Around **70 problems**
- Focus on interview-style questions
- Simulate real OA pressure

## Final Thoughts

This won’t be easy.

But I hope I can make it.

If I succeed, this won’t just be for one interview —  
it will be something I can **carry forward**, instead of starting over every time.

Let’s see how far I can go.

export const Highlight = ({ children, color = "#25c13f" }) => (
  <span
    style={{
      display: "inline-block",
      backgroundColor: `${color}20`,
      color,
      padding: "0.05em 0.2em",
      fontWeight: 500,
      lineHeight: 1.4,
      whiteSpace: "nowrap",
    }}

>

    {children}

  </span>
);

ps: Today is Christmas day! <Highlight>Merry Christmas!</Highlight>
